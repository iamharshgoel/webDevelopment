**Combining Selectors**

1. Multiple Selectors

*üí° element .class  vs  element.class

* element.class means they are in one element only.
* element .class defines parent-child relationship.

#Selector Priority:-

**id > class > tag** in external CSS but if we change any style in internal CSS thenit will override the external CSS

So, internalCSS > externalCSS(id > class > tag)

* Avoid inline styles at all cost because it is a vey bad practice while debugging or have poor readability.
